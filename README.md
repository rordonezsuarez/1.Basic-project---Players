Hi teacher! if you are here is because you are correting my practice now, so i need tell you few things about my project.

First: All the comments in the project are in english because the subject is in english and i think do this is perfect because web programming use english words and that make me feel better when i try to developer my knowledge from the language

Second: I use W3SCHOOLS and other pages to recolect information about how do functions and other things, if you see that,dont worry,i know how do that things and i copy paste wiht knowledge

Third: I hope you like my first programming web using Javascript and HTML

Fourth: The website have comments for everything, i do that because if i see the code in the future in one quick see i can remember how the code it was made

/////////////// HAVE A NICE DAY ///////////////
